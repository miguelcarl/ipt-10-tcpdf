The Lord Of The Rings, Chapter By Chapter: The Shadow Of The Past

“The Shadow of the Past” is the first of two main exposition chapters, the other, of course, being Book Two’s “The Council of Elrond“. I would consider this one more important because, at this early stage, the exposition is way more important. A lot of questions have been raised in the readers mind by the events of the first chapter, and Tolkien, to his credit, isn’t going to be drawing things out for too long. By the time Elrond comes around, we’re fully aware of the magnitude of the quest and what has to be done, it’s mostly just filling stuff out and introducing new characters. The bedrock of the story that Tolkien wants to tell is being revealed here and now.
