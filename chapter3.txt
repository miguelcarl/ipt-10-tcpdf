The Lord Of The Rings, Chapter By Chapter: Three Is Company

A few weeks have passed “in-universe” but we start pretty much where we left off, with Frodo and Gandalf discussing the more delicate details of the coming quest. “The Shadow Of The Past” was for grand pronouncements but you really need some firmer directions before things can kick off properly. But even now, with Gandalf pushing Frodo out the door, it’s still very vague: “‘As for where I am going,’ said Frodo, ‘it would be difficult to give that away, for I have no clear idea myself, yet.’” The sanctuary of Rivendell, well-remembered from Bilbo’s time there in The Hobbit, becomes the set target: Frodo will walk in Bilbo’s footsteps, at least for a while.
